    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>2 ⅔ cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 pinches salt</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>¾ cup milk</li>
        <li>¾ cup vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch cake tin with cooking spray and line with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, vanilla extract, and salt together in a large bowl. Add eggs, milk, and vegetable oil; mix by hand or beat with an electric mixer on low speed until smooth. Add more flour if batter is too runny. Pour into the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert cake carefully onto a cooling rack. Let cool completely.</li>
